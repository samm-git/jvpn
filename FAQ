Q: jvpn is not working for me
A: Try to enable debug output. You will find logs in the 
   ~/.juniper_networks/network_connect/ directory. Also you can try ncui mode.

Q: Is it possible to run jvpn on ARM/MIPS/PPC?
A: No, because it using Juniper's closed source VPN client binary available only
    for i386 platform.

Q: Where should I send patches?
A: Use "pull request" at https://github.com/samm-git/jvpn/. Or just by email.

Q: Could you help me with my VPN account, it does not work?
A: Only if you can provide credentials to test. I need them to debug 
   connection from native GUI and jvpn to identify what is going wrong.
   Also you can try to debug yourself. Some tools I use:
    * Wireshark/tcpdump - to dump traffic between ncsvc and Java GUI
    * strace - to trace VPN processes
    * Java decompiler - to decompile source code of GUI, not too much 
      interesting, anyway

Q: Is it possible to use jvpn on FreeBSD?
A: No. FreeBSD supports Linux ABI, but ncsvc heavily depends on Linux network
   stack, including /proc/net/route, /proc/net/tun, etc. It _should_ be
   possible to emulate all this staff or to use LD_PRELOAD hacks, but it will
   require much more effort.

   If you get it working, please send a patch.

Q: What if I get status=6e and Authentication failed
A: Check the location of your ifconfig binary. It should be at /sbin/ifconfig
